Operating system simulator I created in Fall 2024 during my time as a student.

1. Utilizes multi-threaded systems to regulate Userland and kerneland processes
2. Handles process scheduling, process sleeping, as well as piping
3. Has a virtual memory page based system that allocates 1000 bytes to each process (indiscriminately)
